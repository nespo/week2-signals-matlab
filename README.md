# Week 2 — Signals in MATLAB

This project generates and visualizes six common signals used in Signals & Systems:

- **Unit Impulse** (δ(t), shown as a vertical spike at t=0)
- **Unit Step** (u(t))
- **Unit Ramp** (r(t) = t·u(t))
- **Exponential** (x(t) = e^(−0.2·t), defined for all t)
- **Signum** (sgn(t))
- **Sinc** (sinc(t) = sin(t)/t, with sinc(0)=1)

## How to Run
1. Open MATLAB in this folder.  
2. Run:
   ```matlab
   signals
