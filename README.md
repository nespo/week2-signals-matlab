# Week 2 — Signals in MATLAB

This project generates and plots six common continuous-time signals using MATLAB:

- **Unit Impulse** (δ(t), shown as a spike at t=0)
- **Unit Step** (u(t))
- **Unit Ramp** (r(t) = t·u(t))
- **Exponential** (x(t) = e^(−0.2·t))
- **Signum** (sgn(t))
- **Sinc** (sinc(t) = sin(t)/t, with sinc(0)=1)

## How to Run
1. Open MATLAB in this folder.  
2. Run:
   ```matlab
   signals
3. Two figures will be created:

   Figure1_signals.png → impulse, step, ramp, exponential, signum
   
   Figure2_sinc.png → sinc function

Plots are also saved inside the figures/ folder.
